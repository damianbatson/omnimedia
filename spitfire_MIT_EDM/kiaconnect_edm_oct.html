      <p>The superbly designed <a href="http://www.kia.co.nz/vehicles/cerato-hatch.aspx" target="_blank">Cerato</a> is the best-selling model in the Kia line-up and that popularity is set to continue following an upgrade to the range,  and the introduction of a sharply-priced <a href="http://www.kia.co.nz/vehicles/cerato-hatch.aspx" target="_blank">LX model</a> available from just $28,990 + ORC. </p>
      <p> All the latest Cerato <a href="http://www.kia.co.nz/vehicles/cerato-hatch.aspx" target="_blank">hatchbacks</a>, <a href="http://www.kia.co.nz/vehicles/cerato-sedan.aspx" target="_blank">sedans</a> and the <a href="http://www.kia.co.nz/vehicles/cerato-koup.aspx" target="_blank">Koup</a> now sport a refreshed, stylish interior with a superior quality finish and an exciting range of new exterior colours. 
        SX models also receive a lift to the front styling through a superior light spread with Kia's distinctive LED daytime running lights and new fog lights.</p>
      <p> Hands-on drivers will love the sophisticated paddle shifters on the SX models, giving them the chance to enjoy some sporty gear changes.        </p>
      <p>Another key to the success of Cerato in New Zealand is the advanced suspension system. Finely tuned especially for Australasian markets, the Cerato ride and handling balance is perfectly suited to our roads. It is also tuned to make the most of the power-assisted steering, resulting in fantastic fuel economy with an estimated <a href="http://www.kia.co.nz/about/fuel-calculator.aspx" target="_blank">2 to 3% saving on fuel.</a></p>
      <p>The Kia Cerato is another great example of world-leading design and technology that continues to thrill New Zealand drivers.</p>

      <p>Here's a sneak peek at the all-new Kia <a href="http://www.kiamotors.com/about-kia/company/corporate-news-view.aspx?idx=628&amp;Page=1&amp;s1=1&amp;sv=" target="_blank">Carens</a> lifestyle wagon that we are looking to reintroduce to the New Zealand market in 2013.</p>
      <p>The new model was unveiled at the recent Paris Auto Salon and highlights the exciting design direction being driven by Kia's Chief Design Officer Peter Schreyer and his team.</p>
      <p>It's styled in true Kia fashion with chiselled fog lights, the signature tiger nose grille and long swept-back headlights that will ensure the Carens stands out on the road.</p>
      <p>The new Carens is roomy and versatile, with seating for five to seven people, with the second and third rows of seats folding flat into the floor. Each seat can be slid back and forth individually, for more versatility. Kia is evaluating four engine choices, including two versions of the 1.7-litre diesel engine, a 1.6-litre GDI petrol engine and a 2-litre petrol engine. It is available with either 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic transmissions.</p>
      <p>Further details will be announced over the following months.</p>

      <p>Congratulations to Gordon Andrew from Palmerston North who won a Kia Picanto after purchasing a Kia Cerato in the 2012 National Fieldays promotion.</p>
      <p>Gordon's replacement of his 11 year old Honda Civic with the santorini blue Kia Cerato SX hatchback was the perfect choice after considering all options.</p>
      <p>When Mark Davenport from <a href="http://www.manawatukia.co.nz/" target="_blank">Manawatu Kia</a> phoned Gordon with the exciting news, he was totally surprised. The timing was perfect for Linda (his wife) whose birthday was coming up and the Picanto was a great replacement for her 2001 Honda Logo.</p>
      <p>Manawatu Kia now have a fully converted Kia family with both Linda and Gordon enjoying their new Kias.</p>

      <p>Kia is revving up its environmental credentials around the world in order to drive down the carbon footprint of it's vehicles and manufacturing processes.</p>
      <p>And here in New Zealand we are doing our bit to make a difference, too.<br />
        Kia Motors NZ has embarked on a sustainability programme to gain <a href="http://www.carbonzero.co.nz/" target="_blank">CarboNZero </a>Certification – which consists of a rigorous audit  of our activities in New Zealand and how we can reduce and/or offset our carbon footprint, with the intention of becoming fully and transparently carbon neutral.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="kiaSectionFiveTextUnder">
      <p>That puts Kia Motors NZ right up at the same level with its international parent, which is investing US$2.25 billion – 6% of total sales revenue – in research and development this year alone, much of it aimed at reducing the company's impact on the environment.</p>
      <p>That level of investment has helped Kia to become 44% more eco-efficient than in 2004, when it began measuring its environmental impact. Some of that is due to improved manufacturing techniques, reduced use of hazardous chemicals/substances and greater recycling.</p>
      <p>In fact, two of Kia's big manufacturing facilities in Korea produced no landfill waste whatsoever last year, helping to reduce its global production of waste materials by 28% compared to the 2003 level.</p>
      <p>In Europe, Kia has been supporting the <a href="http://www.kiamotors.com/about-kia/sustainability-management/social-activities-planting.aspx" target="_blank">'Planting for a Better Life' </a>Mali project in West Africa, which has already planted 3.5 million trees since 2007. Kia promises to plant up to six million additional jatropha shrubs over the next three years, helping to secure a brighter future for communities in the area by boosting agricultural output and generating income for farmers and their families.</p>
      <p>All those efforts are on top of the progress being made in the development of vehicles that use less fuel and emit fewer emissions, thanks to high-tech engines and transmissions now featuring in models like the <a href="http://www.kia.co.nz/vehicles/picanto.aspx" target="_blank">Picanto</a>, <a href="http://www.kia.co.nz/vehicles/rio.aspx" target="_blank">Rio</a>, <a href="http://www.kia.co.nz/vehicles/cerato-hatch.aspx" target="_blank">Cerato</a>, <a href="http://www.kia.co.nz/vehicles/optima.aspx" target="_blank">Optima</a>, <a href="http://www.kia.co.nz/vehicles/sportage.aspx" target="_blank">Sportage</a> and <a href="http://www.kia.co.nz/vehicles/sorento.aspx" target="_blank">Sorento</a>.</p>
      <p>If that is not enough, Kia Motors has just announced that it will increase its research and development spend by a further 12% in 2013 to US$2.52 billion so that it can speed up the process.</p>

    <div id="kiaSectionFuelSavingGraphic"><div id="kiaFuelSavingText">
      <p>Vehicles made by Kia are among the most efficient on the road, but with rising petrol and diesel prices it certainly pays to adopt good fuel-saving practices. Try these:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If your car's petrol, chances are it doesn't need high octane fuel. So save and fill up with 91.</li>
          <li>Check the tyre pressures regularly. Under-inflated tyres create more road friction and increase fuel consumption.</li>
          <li>If you're driving at motorway speed, open windows can create wind resistance and increase fuel use. If you want some fresh air, open all the air vents.</li>
          <li>Don't leave the A/C on all the time. Using it occasionally could save you fuel.
          Carrying empty ski racks on your car roof creates wind drag. Fit them when needed.</li>
          <li>Remove heavy items from your car boot if they are not required. More weight equals more fuel use.</li>
          <li>Driving above the open road speed limit burns more fuel. Keep to the limit and save. it's safer, too.</li>
          <li>And lastly, don't hold onto lower gears longer than you need to. Getting into higher gears early can make significant savings.</li>
      </ul>
